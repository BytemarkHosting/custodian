  This is the worker component.

  It is designed to pull (testing) jobs from the beanstalk queue, executing them serially.

  The jobs will be serialized JSON objects which have the following keys in all cases:

    * test_type => ping | ssh | mysql | http | https | ...
    * test_target => example.com | 192.168.0.1 | etc

  Tests may implement additional keys, they will be used or ignored as appropriate.

  There is no concept of an execution time, nor is there any threading to worry about.
