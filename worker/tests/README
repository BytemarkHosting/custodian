  This directory contains the protocol-tests.

  For the protocol "xxx" we must have:

        - The file called xxx.rb

        - The definition of class "XXXTest" - note upper-case

  The class must implement the methods:

    run_test

    get_details

  'run_test' will be called to run the test, returning true if passed, and false
 otherwise.  In the event of a test failure 'get_details' will return
 something useful.
