  This directory contains the protocol-tests.

  For the protocol "XXX" we must have:

        - The file called XXX.rb

        - The definition of the single method XXX_test

  The test will make use of "target_host", and "test_port" (other keys may be optionally
 used) and will return the single result:

        false:  The test failed.

        true:  The test succeeded.
