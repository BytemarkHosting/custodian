custodian (0.8-5) stable; urgency=low

  * When sending alerts via Mauve the ID of the alert must be unique,
    per-source.  We thought we'd achieved this by using the input line
    from the parser, but sadly there is a 255 character limit.
    Use the SHA1 hash of the input to satisfy both constraints.

custodian (0.3-1) stable; urgency=low

    - JSON is not used to serialize tests in the queue.
    - The parser and the queue insertion are now decoupled.
    - The test-suite is updated.
    - Many classes were moved into the custodian name-space, and renamed.

custodian (0.1119-3) stable; urgency=low

  * Many service probes read a banner from a remote server, and then test it
    is sane.  For example looking for "ssh", or "smtp" in the string we read.
    Ensure we read a string prior to testing for a given response.
  * Avoid potential shell-injection attacks against HTTP probes.
