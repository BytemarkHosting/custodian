Description: remote monitoring via distributed agents
 This package allows you to setup a semi-distributed monitoring
 solution, using the Bytemark MauveAlert server for notification.
 .
 The monitoring consists of a system to enqueue tests in
 a beanstalkd server, and an agent that will fetch tests from
 that same queue and execute them.

Architecture: all
Depends: custodian, ruby, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Bytemark-specific add-ons for Custodian.
 This package contains some monitoring for the monitor,
 to ensure that custodian isn't failing to parse configuration
 files, or failing to empty the queue.
 .
 It might be useful reference material for others but it is
 explicitly Bytemark-specific
