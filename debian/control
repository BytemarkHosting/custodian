Description: This package provides remote monitoring
 This package allows you to setup a semi-distributed monitoring
 solution, using the Bytemark MauveAlert server for notification.
 .
 The monitoring consists of a system to enqueue tests in
 a beanstalkd server, and an agent that will fetch tests from
 that same queue and execute them.
