1.  Decouple the parsing from the queue insertion.
   Use a callback in the driver + yield to push items into the queue.


2.  Don't use beanstalk client directly, subclass custodian/queue, or similar
   to allow us to swap out the queue and stub it for testing.

3.  Use a class factory to instantiate tests on the worker-side.

4.  Use either a proper grammer, or use the protocol-tests when parsing.

5.  Rewrite rsync/ssh/ftp, etc, as a subclass of tcp.rb
