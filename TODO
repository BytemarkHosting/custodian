Use a class factory to instantiate tests on the worker-side.
-> This is in-progress.  Test it with:
     ./bin/custodian-parse-execute "kvm1.vm must run smtp."

Rewrite rsync/ssh/ftp, etc, as a subclass of tcp.rb
-> This is in-progress.

The HTTP/HTTPS-probe should be pure Ruby.  Patrick will give me a stub.
